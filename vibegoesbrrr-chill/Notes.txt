1. for props need to be able to switch the owner when attached/detached, needs testing
2. documentation
3. unit tests

Warnings/Errors:

Long term updates:
1. support connecting device & loading avatar in any order
2. looking at SetActive on all game objects just to find props. need to find a better way. this will hurt performance during world/avatar loading.
3. need new download link in BuildInfo.cs
4. something is causing a hanging thread that prevents the game from quiting properly, only when connected to intiface.
